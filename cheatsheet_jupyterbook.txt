# jupyter book 
build.py builds the html site 
            and copies all /_build/ png,svg and pdf files to the root
			to enable figures in the latex build 
           

python build.py # creates thebook as html 
python build.py latex # creates thebook as html and latex
python build.py test # creates thetestbook as html 
python build.py test latex # creates thetestbook   as html and latex

Build without python looks like 
jb build testbook/ --builder html

For latex: 
miktex (version 22.1) and TeXworks (version 0.6.6)
For typesetting: XeLaTex0MakeIndex+BibTeX

:::{admonition} Note
:class: tip

The equations for Labor and Capital have been entered as difference equations. 
The ```modelflow``` object will automatically normalize them, generating an internal representation of ```Labour=Labour(t-1)*(1+Labor_growth)```
and ```Capital=Capital(t-1)*(1-Depreciation_rate)+Investment```
