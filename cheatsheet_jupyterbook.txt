# jupyter book 
build.py builds the html site 
            and copies all /_build/ png,svg and pdf files to the root
			to enable figures in the latex build 
           

python build.py # creates thebook as html 
python build.py latex # creates thebook as html and latex
python build.py test # creates thetestbook as html 
python build.py test latex # creates thetestbook   as html and latex

Build without python looks like 
jb build testbook/ --builder html

For latex: 
miktex (version 22.1) and TeXworks (version 0.6.6)
For typesetting: XeLaTex0MakeIndex+BibTeX  

don't use:
$$
\begin{align*}
y_t &=\bigl[\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}X_t + y\_AF_t\bigr]\cdot (1-0) + 0 \cdot y\_X_t\\
y_t &=\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}X_t + y\_AF_t
\end{align*}
$$

use 
\begin{align*}
y_t &=\bigl[\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}X_t + y\_AF_t\bigr]\cdot (1-0) + 0 \cdot y\_X_t\\
y_t &=\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}X_t + y\_AF_t
\end{align*}
