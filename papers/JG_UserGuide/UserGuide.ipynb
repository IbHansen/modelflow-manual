    "# MFMod-JG - the Jobs and Growth model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MFMod-JG** is a member of the broader `MFMod` framework, which is comprised of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`MFMod`** which is the World Bank's main forecasting model \n",
    "* **MFModSA** a large number of customized country specific models that have been developed from MFMod but as \"Stand Alone\" models\n",
    "* **MFMod-CC** which are a specialized set of Stand Alones developed to analyze the whole-economy effects of climate change and climate policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main model **MFMod** is described in detail in Burns et al. (2019) and is comprised of 184 individual country models and is used as the main tool for forecasting in the World Bank's *Macro Poverty Outlook*, *Global Economic Prospects* publications and in a variety of country and region-specific publications, including *Country Economic Memorandum's* and *Public Finance Reviews*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**MFModSA's** are single-country models that take as a starting point a country model within MFMod but then typically extend it by adding additional fiscal, sectoral and financial details.  Examples of Stand Alones include:  .  \n",
    "\n",
    "**MFMod-CC** are standalones that have been to analyze the whole-economy effects of climate change and climate policy.  Some of the early specific additions made to the standard framework in these models is described in Burns et al (2020, 2021), while Jooste et al (2023) provides a more recent description of these climate-ware versions of the broader framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the model derived from the `MFMod` framework are neo-Keynsian models comprised of a detailed demand-side, a production side and a supply-side. In the models, the demand and production sides are aligned (production plus net stock-building equals demand), but may differ from the supply potential of the economy.  This supply-side anchors the long-run in the models and is typically derived from a simple Cobb-Douglas framework where potential output at time t ($Y_t^{*}$) is a function of trend Total Factor Productivity ($A_t$) , structural employment ($L_t^{*}$) , and the capital stock ($K_t$) and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y^{*}_t = A_t K^{1-\\alpha}_t {L_t^{*}}^{\\alpha} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and where $\\alpha$ represents labor's share in total income.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The MFMod-JG models\n",
    "The Jobs and Growth variant of the `MFMod` framework described in this note, focus almost exclusively on the supply-side of the wider framework, but extend it by introducing elements of endogenous growth theory, the influence of structural transformations on aggregate `TFP`, a more detailed representation of labor supply and a simplified poverty projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the `MFMod-JG` is to permit the user to generate a long-term growth path based on a more nuanced understanding of the relative contributions of demographics, labor market dynamics, structural change and human-capital investment in determining aggregate output. Unlike the other models, it is not a whole-of-the economy simulation model -- although the supply side derived in MFMod-JG can be introduced into the other frameworks for deeper whole of the economy simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A varied approach to modeling potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on a single formulation of potential output, `MFMod-JG` is comprised of several models each of which presents a slightly different representation of potential output. Each representation is derived from a simple identity for potential output, including but not limited to the standard Solow-Swann formulation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "These views can be manipulated separately or sequentially to develop a more nuanced story than could be done if one were restricted to only one of the versions of the standard CD model.  This is a similar approach to that taken by the Penning and Loyaza (2018,2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "The current versions of MFMSA-JG includes the following representations (sub-models) of potential output.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Top-down model:** A standard CD style production function where total factor productivity, capital and labor determine potential.  Potential can be altered by changes in TFP, investment or investment rate, human capital and changes in participation or unemployment rates. \n",
    "3.\t**The structural change model**  deviates from the C-D framework.  It determine potential output as a function of sectoral Labor productivity and  sectoral employment or via sectoral output and sectoral productivity.  In this framework, TFP in the CD framework adjusts to be coherent with the potential output that is generated by this version of the model.\n",
    "3.\t**The investment/savings model** is a variant of the top-down model, where the investment rate is endogenous and determined by the availability of foreign savings (CA balance), government saving and private saving.  This model can be used to analyze influence of Long-term fiscal policy or confidence effects on growth, but can also be used to understand the financing needs of given investment paths.\n",
    "4.\t**The Demographic model** is variant of the standard top-down model, that allows the user to adjust labor supply, at a more disaggregated level, notably with gender specific participation and unemployment rates.\n",
