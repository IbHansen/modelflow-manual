# Introduction

```{warning}
This Jupyter book is work in progress and very much a draft.

Please send any suggestions and comments to Ib 
```

The purpose of this [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is to show some examples of different models in the **Modelflow** (aka **PCIM 2.0**) framework.

This Jupyterbook is **displaying** a number of individual notebooks which each shows different aspects of the model and the framework. Most of the notebooks can be executed in the cloud. Either through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Mybinder](https://mybinder.org/)

For more information on the capabilities of the framework look in [this manual](https://ibhansen.github.io/mfbook). It is based on the 
the handeling of the [World Bank's macroeconomic and fiscal model\(MFMod\)](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/32217) 

ModelFlow is a Python library developed to leverage on the Pandas data management library and the broader Python ecosystem. Using Modelflow you can:
 - Solve models
 - Analyze models
 - Analyze results
 - Visualize results 


**Model Specification** With ModelFlow you can specify your models as concise and intuitive equations. ModelFlow transforms your equations into Python code and solves your model.

**Large models**.
ModelFlow can handle models with 1 million equations and more. The library is therefore also suited for very large models.

**Agile model development**
The models are specified at a high level of abstraction and are processed fast. This makes ModelFlow the obvious choice when developing and experimenting with large models.

**Onboarding models**.
Creating a model often entails recycling several models specified in different ways: Eviews, Excel, Latex, Dynare, Python and other languages/tools.
ModelFlow, which is nested in the Python's ecosystem, makes it possible to transform models defined in many different languages into ModelFlow models.

**Onboarding data**.
ModelFlow is build on top of Pythons Pandas Library. Pandas is the swiss army knife for datascience and has a lot of data wrangeling capabilities and in addition makes it easy to import and manage data from different sources.

**Analytic** ModelFlow provides you with a range of visual tools that help you understand your models and your results.

**Open Source**
Be part of the community. The entire library is written in Python and is to be found on this [Github page](https://github.com/IbHansen/Modelflow2)  . So you can adjust the tools to your needs or help develope the library further.

The documentation can be viewed [here](https://ibhansen.github.io/doc)
