    "\n",
    "Instead of mixing economic reasoning with programming details, a model can be written in a **domain-specific language (DSL)** designed specifically for economics and finance. Separating specification from implementation has several advantages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity and focus** – The specification remains close to the underlying economic logic, expressed in a concise and readable form. The modeler concentrates on *what the relationships are*, not on *how the computer solves them*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expressiveness** – The DSL uses syntax familiar to economists (equations, lags, variables), avoiding the clutter of general-purpose programming constructs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintainability** – Models can be extended or updated without rewriting solution code. Changing an equation is as simple as editing one line in the specification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Portability** – Once specified, the same model can be executed with different numerical engines or platforms without altering its economic content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transparency** – The separation makes models easier to review, validate, and communicate, since the specification reads like economic theory rather than computer code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is common in several econometric systems such as **EViews**, **Dynare**, and **GEKKO**, which all use their own DSLs to describe models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**ModelFlow** follows a similar philosophy but with a key difference: it does not introduce a new language for data handling, visualization, or model analysis. Instead, ModelFlow relies on the **Python ecosystem** - primarily `pandas`, but also `networkx`, `sympy`, `numpy`, and other libraries - allowing the model specification to be combined seamlessly with powerful tools for data manipulation, result analysis, and visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Simple Specification Language  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the DSL for economic models is built around equation-like statements. For example:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Frml <stoc> C = a0 + a1*Y(-1) + epsC $\n",
    "Frml Y = C + I + G + X - M $\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here each formula (`Frml`) defines the relationship between variables in a way that mirrors how economists usually write them, with lags (`(-1)`) and simple algebraic notation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The optional `<tag>` is used for transforming the frml or to control solving - more on that later.\n",

    "- **Stripped-down syntax** – allows equations to be written without explicit `Frml` and `$` markers, resulting in cleaner, more compact specifications.  \n",

    "- **Consistency:** All model blocks use identical definitions and structural setup.  \n",
    "- **Convenience:** The resulting constructor behaves exactly like `Mexplode`, but with defaults already filled in.  \n",

    "## Building modular models by combining smaller formula groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex models often consist of multiple logical components — such as behavioral equations, accounting identities, or sector-specific submodels.  \n",
    "Instead of defining one large block of equations in a single string, it’s often more efficient to **specify smaller groups of formulas** and then combine them into a complete model using the `+` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why this approach is beneficial\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity:** Each `Mexplode` object can represent a distinct part of the model — for example, a banking block, a household sector, or a price system.  \n",
    "- **Clarity:** Smaller, self-contained equation groups are easier to read, debug, and test independently.  \n",
    "- **Reusability:** You can reuse model fragments across projects or scenarios by simply combining them differently.  \n",
    "- **Incremental development:** Start with a minimal subset of formulas, verify behavior, and then expand the model progressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `+` operator merges multiple `Mexplode` objects into a single `Lexplode` container, which behaves like a unified model.  \n",
    "This aggregation does not recompute anything — it simply combines their normalized forms, making it fast and memory-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we define two small model blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each block is defined as an independent `Mexplode`, and then we combine them using `+`.  \n",
    "This creates a single integrated model (`Lexplode`) that can be displayed or solved as one unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In larger models, it’s good practice to define separate logical components (blocks) for different economic or financial relationships.  \n",
    "Here, we define three related parts of a simple very stylized credit risk model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PD update block** – describes how each bank’s probability of default (`PD`) evolves.  \n",
    "2. **Expected Loss block** – calculates expected losses as a function of exposure, PD, and loss given default (`LGD`).\n",
    "3. **Bank Expected Loss block** – calculates expected losses for each bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each block is created as an independent `Mexplode` object.  \n",
    "We then combine them with the `+` operator to form a complete integrated model (`Lexplode`), which can be solved or analyzed as one structure.\n"
