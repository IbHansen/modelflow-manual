# jupyter book 
build.py builds the html site 
            and copies all /_build/ png,svg and pdf files to the root
			to enable figures in the latex build 
           

python build.py # creates thebook as html 
python build.py latex # creates thebook as html and latex
python build.py test # creates thetestbook as html 
python build.py test latex # creates thetestbook   as html and latex

Build without python looks like 
jb build testbook/ --builder html

For latex: 
miktex (version 22.1) and TeXworks (version 0.6.6)
For typesetting: XeLaTex0MakeIndex+BibTeX

:::{admonition} Box 3. Time scope of .upd() commands

The update command takes a variety of mathematical operators =, +, *, % =GROWTH, +GROWTH, =DIFF and applies them to data for the period set in the leading <>.

If the user wants to modify a series or group of series for only a specific point in time or a period of time, she can indicate the period in the command line.

If one date is specified the operation is applied to a single point in time
If two dates are specifies the operation is applied over a period of time.
The selected time period will persist until re-set with a new time specification. This is useful if several variables are going to be updated for the same time period, but must be kept in mind if subsequent commands are to operate over a different time period.

The time period can be reset to the full time-period by using the special <-0 -1> time period. More generally:

-0 indicates the start of the dataframe
-1 indicates the end of the dataframe
If no time is provided the dataframe start and end period will be used.

:::{Margin} Text to appear bolded

This produces a nice looking box around the text. Might work better as margin Box 1 My box.

don't use:
$$
