    "# The Modelflow class in python\n",
    "\n",
    "```ModelFlow``` is a Python library developed to leverage on the Pandas data management library and the broader Python ecosystem. Using ```Modelflow``` you can:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Solve models\n",
    " - Analyze models\n",
    " - Analyze results\n",
    " - Visualize results \n",
    " \n",
    " **Model Specification** With ModelFlow you can specify your models as concise and intuitive equations. ModelFlow automatically transforms your equations into Python code and solves your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large models**.\n",
    "ModelFlow can handle models with 1 million equations and more. The library is therefore also suited for very large models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agile model development**\n",
    "The models are specified at a high level of abstraction and are processed quickly. This makes ModelFlow the obvious choice when developing and experimenting with large models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Onboarding models**.\n",
    "Creating a model often entails recycling several models specified in different ways: Eviews, Excel, Latex, Dynare, Python and other languages/tools. ModelFlow 'business logic' provides a simple syntax that makes it possible to transform models defined in many different languages into ModelFlow models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Onboarding data**.\n",
    "ModelFlow is built on top of Python's Pandas Library. Pandas is the swiss army knife for datascience and has a lot of data wrangling capabilities, which makes it easy to import and manage data from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytic** ModelFlow includes a range of visual tools that help you understand your models and your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open Source**\n",
    "ModelFlow is open source. The entire library is written in Python and can be found here [Github page](https://github.com/IbHansen/Modelflow2). Users can download and use as is, or adjust the included tools to their needs and perhaps make a contribution to the main library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelflow documentation can be viewed [here](https://ibhansen.github.io/doc).\n"
