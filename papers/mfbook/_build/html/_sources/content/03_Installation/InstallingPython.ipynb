    "# Installation of Modelflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelflow is a python package that defines the ```model``` class, its methods and a number of other functions that extend and combine pre-existing python functions to allow the easy solution of complex systems of equations including macro-structural models like MFMod.  To work with ```modelflow```, a user needs to first install python (preferably the Anaconda variant), several supporting packages, and of course the ```modelflow``` package itself.  While ```modelflow``` can be run directly from the python command-line or IDEs (Interactive Development Environments) like ```Spyder``` or Microsoft's ```Visual Code```, it is suggested that users also install the Jupyter notebook system. Jupyter Notebook facilitates an interactive approach to building python programs, annotating them and ultimately doing simulations using MFMod under ```modelflow```. This entire manual and the examples in it were all written and executed in the Jupyter Notebook environment."

    "\n",
    "Python is an extremely powerful and versatile and extensible open-source language. It is widely used for artificial intelligence application, interactive web sites, and scientific processing. As of 14 November 2022, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contained over 415,000 packages that extend its functionality [^pythonLibrary]. Modelflow is one of these packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes in many flavors and ```modelflow``` will work with any of them.  However, it is strongly suggested that you use the Anaconda version of Python.  The remainder of this section points to instructions on how to install the Anaconda version of python (under Windows, MacOS and under Linux). Modelflow works equally well under all three.\n",

    "This is followed by section that describes the steps necessary to create an anaconda environment with all the necessary packages to run ```modelflow```.\n",
