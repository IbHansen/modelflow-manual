    "# Introduction to  Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    " Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating, annotating, experimenting and working with computational documents.  Originally developed for python, the latest versions of EViews also support jupyter Notebooks. Junpyter Notebook (JN) offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience and can be a great environment for documenting the work you are doing, and trying alternative methods of achieving desirable results.  Many of the methods in ```modelflow``` have been developed to work well with Jupyter notebook and indeed this documentation was written as a series of Jupyter Notebooks bound together with Jupyter Book.\n",
    " \n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is not the only way to work with modelflow or Python.  Indeed, as users become more advanced they are likely to migrate to a more program-centric IDE (Interactive Development Environment) like Spyder or Microsoft Visual Code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to start Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to learn, follow work done by others and tweak them to fit your own needs."

    "## The idea of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind jupyter notebook \\[JN\\] was to create an interactive version of the notebooks that scientists use(d) to:\n",
    "* record what they have done\n",
    "* perhaps explain why\n",
    "* document how data was generated, and \n",
    "* record the results of their experiments  \n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for these notebooks and Jupyter notebook is to encourage practices that will ensure that if followed exactly by others, that they will be able to generate the same results. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupter Notebook cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A JN does all of that (and perhaps a bit more).  It is divided into 'cells'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***JN Cells can contain:***\n",
    "* **computer code** (typically python code, but as noted other kernels -- like Eviews -- can be used with jupyter).\n",
    "* **markdown text**: plain text that can include special characters that make some text appear as bold, or indicate the text is headers, or instruct JN to render the text as a mathematical formula.  All of the text in this document was entered using JN's markdown language\n",
    "* Results (in the form of tables or graphs) from the execution of computer code specified in a code cell\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every cell has two modes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit mode -- indicated by a green vertical bar. In edit mode the user can change the code, or the markdown.\n",
    "2. Select/Copy mode -- indicated by a blue vertical bar.  This will be teh state of the cell when its content has been executed.  For markdown cells this means that the text and special characters have been rendered into formatted text.  For code cells, this means the code has been executed and its output (if any) displayed in an output cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook has associated with it a \"Kernel\", which is an instance of the computing environment in which code will be executed. For JN taht work with modelflow this will be a Python Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note} Jupyter Notebooks were designed to facilitate _replicability_: the idea that a scientific analysis should contain - in addition to the final output (text, graphs, tables) - all the computational steps needed to get from raw input data to the results.\n",
