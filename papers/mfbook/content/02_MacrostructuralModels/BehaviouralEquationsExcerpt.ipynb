    "## Behavioural equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioural equations in a macrostructural equation are typically estimated. In MFMod they are often expressed in Error Correction form. In this approach the behaviour of the dependent variable (say Consumption) is assumed to be the joint product of a long-term economic relationship -- usually drawn from economic theory, and various short-run influences which can be more ad hoc in nature. The ECM formulation has the advantage of tieing down the long run behavior of the economy to economic theory, while allowing its short-run dynamics (where short-run can in some cases be 5 or more years) to reflect the way the economy actually operates (not how textbooks say it should behave).\n",
