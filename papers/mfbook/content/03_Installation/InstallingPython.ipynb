    "Modelflow is a python package that defines the ```model``` class, its methods and a number of other functions that extend and combine pre-existing python functions to allow the easy solution of complex systems of equations including macro-structural models like MFMod.  To work with ```modelflow```, a user needs to first install python (preferably the Anaconda variant), several supporting packages, and of course the ```modelflow``` package itself.  \n",

    "`Python` is an extremely powerful, versatile and extensible open-source language. It is widely used for artificial intelligence application, interactive web sites, and scientific processing. As of 14 November 2022, the `Python Package Index` (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contained over 415,000 packages that extend its functionality [^pythonLibrary]. Modelflow is one of these packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes in many flavors and `modelflow` will work with any of them.  However, **users are strongly advised to use the Anaconda version of Python**. It is advised to use the **Miniconda** version of the package manager, this is will only install the minimum needed packages. However the full **Anaconda** version can also be used.  \n",
