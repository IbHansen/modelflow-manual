    "# Installation of Modelflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelflow is a python package that defines the ```model``` class, its methods and a number of other functions that extend and combine pre-existing python functions to allow the easy solution of complex systems of equations including macro-structural models like MFMod.  To work with ```modelflow```, a user needs to first install python (preferably the Anaconda or miniconda variants), several supporting packages, and of course the ```modelflow``` package itself.  While ```modelflow``` can be run directly from the python command-line or IDEs (Interactive Development Environments) like ```Spyder``` or Microsoft's ```Visual Code```, it is suggested that users also install the Jupyter notebook system. Jupyter Notebook facilitates an interactive approach to building python programs, annotating them and ultimately doing simulations using MFMod under ```modelflow```. This entire manual and the examples in it were all written and executed in the Jupyter Notebook environment."

    "`Python` is a powerful, versatile and extensible open-source language. It is widely used for artificial intelligence applications, interactive web sites, and scientific processing. As of 14 November 2022, the `Python Package Index` (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contained over 415,000 packages that extend its functionality [^pythonLibrary]. Modelflow is one of these packages.\n",

    "**Anaconda** is a full-featured distribution of python that comes with a comprehensive set of pre-installed packages and tools for scientific computing and data analysis. It is best suited for users who want a ready-to-use platform with a wide range of packages and don't mind the larger installation size. \n",
    "\n",
    "**MiniConda** is a lightweight version of Anaconda, focusing on minimalism and providing only the essential components. It offers faster installation and a smaller footprint, making it suitable for users who prefer a more streamlined environment and want more control over package selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which is better for me\n",
    "In general, MiniConda is preferred by users who desire a minimalistic setup and have specific package requirements, while Anaconda is suitable for users who value convenience and require a comprehensive package ecosystem. If you are already familiar with python, pny plan to sue it with `modelflow` and have space limitations `miniconda` is probnably the best solution for you.  For most users \n",
