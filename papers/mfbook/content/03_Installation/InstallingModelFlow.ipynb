    "# Installation of Modelflow\n",
    "\n",
    "`Modelflow` is a python package that defines the modelflow class `model` among others.  `Modelflow` has many dependencies. Installing the class the first time can take some time depending on your internet connection and computer speed.  It is essential that you follow all of the steps outlined below to ensure that your version of `modelflow` operates as expected.\n",

    ":::{warning}\n",
    "The following instructions concern the installation of ```modelflow``` within an Anaconda installation of python.  Different flavors of Python may require slight changes to this recipe, but are not covered here.\n",

    "`Modelflow` is built and tested using the anaconda python environment.  It is strongly recommended to use Anaconda with `modelflow`.\n",

    "1. Open the anaconda command prompt\n",
    "2. Execute the following commands by copying and pasting them -- either line by line or as a single mult-line step\n",
