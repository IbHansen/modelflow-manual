If you are already familiar with python, plan to use it with `modelflow` and have space limitations `MiniConda` is probably the best solution for you.

Also both distribution can be installed without interferring with eachother.  Both are available for the Windows, MacOS and  Linux operating systems and `Modelflow` should work equally well under all three operating systems. However Only the windows version is used in this material. "
