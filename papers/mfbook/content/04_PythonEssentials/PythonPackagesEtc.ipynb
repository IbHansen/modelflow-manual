    "Before using ```modelflow``` with the World Bank's MFMod models, users  will have to understand at least some basic elements of ```python``` syntax and usage.  Notably they will need to understand about packages, libraries and classes, how to access them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python  packages, libraries and classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features of ```python``` are built-in out-of-the-box.  Others build up on these basic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **python class** is a code template that defines a python object. Classes can have member variables (data) associated with them and methods (behaviours or functions)associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class. An object of type class is created (instantiated) using the classes \"constructor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is a Python object consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.\n",

    "A **python package** is a collection of modules that are related to each other. When a module from an external package is required by a program, that package (or module in the package) must  be **imported** into the current session for its modules can be put to use.  \n",

    "## Importing packages, libraries, modules and classes\n",
