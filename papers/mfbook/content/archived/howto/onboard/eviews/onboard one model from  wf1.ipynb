    "# Import a World Bank Eviews model from its solution file (.wf1)\n",
    "This notebook takes a .wf1 workfile and transforms it into a modelflow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most standard World Bank models should work with limited intervention.  Some using unusual techniques or variable definitions may require intervention by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the import process\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall import process is performed by a special a ModelFlow class named:**GrabWfModel**. Certain steps require the use of EViews itself.  This howoto was designed usinng EViews version 12, but and has been tested with versions 13 and 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to follow:\n",
    " 1. Start EViews and open the solution file \n",
    "    -    If returning to this step after an initial error perform transformations on the data (needed in some cases where special EViews functions are used in the model).\n",
    "    -    The UNlink the model. This transforms linked equations into explicit equations in the EViews model object. \n",
    "    -    Save the revised model and data as a .wf2 file. (the .wf2 is a JSON format that can be easily read into python).\n",
    "    **QCVD?  Same name with ```_modelflow appended```**\n",
    " 5. Close Eviews.\n",
    " 6. The wf2 file is read as a json file. \n",
    " 7. Relevant objects are extracted. \n",
    " 7. The MFMSA variable is  extracted, to be saved in the dumpfile. \n",
    " 8. The equations are transformed and normalized to modelflow format and classified into identities and stochastic\n",
    " 9. Stochastic equations are enriched by add_factor and fixing terms (dummy + fixing value)  \n",
    " 9. For Stochastic equations new fitted variables are generated - without add add_factors and dummies.  \n",
    " 9. A model to generate fitted variables is created  \n",
    " 9. A model to generate add_factors is created. \n",
    " 9. A model encompassing the original equations, the model for fitted variables and for add_factors is created. \n",
    " 9. The data series and scalars are shoveled into a Pandas dataframe \n",
    "     - Some special series are generated as the expression can not be incorporated into modelflow model specifications\n",
    "     - The model for fitted values is simulated in the specified timespan\n",
    "     - The model for add_factors is simulated in the timespan set in MFMSA\n",
    " 10. The data descriptions are extracted into a dictionary. \n",
    "    - Data descriptions for dummies, fixed values, fitted values and add_factors are derived. \n",
    " 11. Now we have a model and a dataframe with all variables which are needed.\n",
    " \n",
    "The GrapWfModel instance in general keeps most of the steps so the developer can inspect the the different steps.  \n"

    "Some expressions found in World Bank equations are functions that have no direct equvalent in python. `GrabWfModel()` is aware of many of these and peforms he necessary adjustments automatically. Others it may not be aware of.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where manual adjustments are necessary, the `GrabWfModel()`procedure will error out and the equatiopns will have to be re-written perhaps as two or more equations manually. \n",

    "\n",
    "which would instruct eviews to run a least squared regression estimating only the intercept `c(1)` and imposting as the slope variable the second coefficient from the second equation `SomeOtherEquation.coeff(2)`.  Modelflow does not have this dynamic mecanism to refer to coefficients in other equations so we must rewrite the equation by first assigning the value of Secondequation.coeff(2) to a scalar and the using that scalar in the equation instead.\n",

    "This is accomplished by passing to `GrabWFModel()` two parameters, the first that contains the ewviws code to be run and the second the change to the equation we need.  These are then run by `GrabWFModel()` before generating the Modelflow version of the model.\n",
