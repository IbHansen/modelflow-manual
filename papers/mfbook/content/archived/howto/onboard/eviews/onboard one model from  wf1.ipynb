    "# Import a World Bank Eviews model from its solution file (.wf1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes a .wf1 workfile and transforms it into a modelflow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most standard World Bank models should work with limited intervention.  Some using unusual techniques or variable definitions may require intervention by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the import process\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall import process is performed by a special a ModelFlow class named:**GrabWfModel**. Certain steps require the use of EViews itself.  This howto was designed using EViews version 12, but has been tested with versions 13 and 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to follow:\n",
    " 1. Start EViews and open the solution file \n",
    "    -    If returning to this step after an initial error perform transformations on the data (needed in some cases where special EViews functions are used in the model).\n",
    "    -    The UNlink the model. This transforms linked equations into explicit equations in the EViews model object. \n",
    "    -    Save the revised model as a .wf2 file  (the .wf2 is a JSON format that can be easily read into python), with the same name as the original file but with \"\\_modelflow\" appended to the name.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 5. Close Eviews.\n",
    " 6. The wf2 file is read as a json file. \n",
    " 7. Relevant objects are extracted. \n",
    " 7. The MFMSAOptions strinng from the views file is  extracted, to be saved in the ModelFlow pcim file. \n",
    " 8. The equations are transformed and normalized to modelflow format and classified into identities and stochastic\n",
    " 9. Stochastic equations are enriched by add_factor and fixing terms (dummy + fixing value)  \n",
    " 9. For Stochastic equations new fitted variables are generated - without add add_factors and dummies.  \n",
    " 9. A model to generate fitted variables is created  \n",
    " 9. A model to generate add_factors is created. \n",
    " 9. A model encompassing the original equations, the model for fitted variables and for add_factors is created. \n",
    " 9. The data series and scalars are shoveled into a Pandas dataframe \n",
    "     - Some special series are generated, for the case where an inline function is used in EViews that can not be translated directly into modelflow model specifications\n",
    "     - The model for fitted values is simulated in the specified timespan\n",
    "     - The model for add_factors is simulated in the timespan set in MFMSAOptions\n",
    " 10. The data descriptions are extracted into a dictionary. \n",
    "    - Data descriptions for dummies, fixed values, fitted values and add_factors are derived. \n",
    " 11. Now we have a model and a dataframe with all variables which are needed.\n",
