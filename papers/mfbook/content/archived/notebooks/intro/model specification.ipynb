    "\n",
    "Modelflow was started in order to build transparent and agile models and in order to be able to recycle and connect a broad range of models from different sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons it should be possible to onboard models from different sources and it should be possible to specify a model in a parsimonious and expressive way. This allows focus  on the economic content without entanglement from implementation and housekeeping details. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose specification of a model typical **flows**  through several phases (hence the flow in modelflow). \n",
    "\n",
    "Which *initial phases* the model specification flows through depend on the nature and origin of the model at hand. Python has a rich set of string manipulation functions which allows different processing in these phases. Some more advanced examples for instance [onboarding a Eviews model](../../howto/onboard/eviews/onboard%20one%20model%20from%20%20wf1.ipynb) is given in the onboarding section of this manual.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The *last phase* is always the model specification in **The Basic Business logic language**. From this specification the model is  transpiled by a python function like this [python solution code for Solow model](solow-python-code)\n",
    "which is needed for both the Gauss and the Newton type solution methods [python solution code](solution-methods). "

It looks to some extend like model specification in packages used for simulation of macroeconomic models like  [Eviews], Gekko, PCIM, Dynare, Aremos or TROLL."
