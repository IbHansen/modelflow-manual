    "# Acknowledgments\n",
    "\n",
    "This book and the development of ModelFlow would not have been possible without the contributions of many individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Special thanks to Jens Boldt, formerly of Danmarks Nationalbank, for his participation in creating the first version of ModelFlow, which was used for the top-down stress testing of banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to extend our gratitude to the following reviewers for their invaluable contributions and insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Freya Casie\n",
    "- Unnada Chewpreecha\n",
    "\n",
    "Their expertise and feedback have significantly enhanced the quality of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the World Bank extensions to ModelFlow and for the documentation of the modelling system in modelflow would not have been possible with out the generous support of the multui-donor CSF Trust Fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models themselves reflect the inputs of many over many years, these include but are not restricted to: Thanh Bui; Benoit Campagne; Unnada Chewpatra; Young Il Choi; Charl Jooste; Francis Dennig; Alex Haider;  Monika Matyja; Chung Gu Lee; Theo Janse van Rensburg; Heather Ruberl; and David Stephan.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work has benefited enormously from the generous financial support of the Climate Support Facility (https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/climate-support-facility#:~:text=The%20CSF%20is%20a%20multi,develop%20long%2Dterm%20climate%20strategies), a multi-donor Trust Fund administered by the World Bank that supports developing countries achieve a green recovery from the effects of COVID-19, implement their NDCs and develop long-term climate strategies.\n"
