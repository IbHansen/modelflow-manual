    "# Foreword\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the decades, the World Bank has invested heavily in the tools available to its country economists to analyze forecast and monitor economic activity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the `MFMod` framework, a system of 184 macro-structural models of nearly all the economies in the world fruit of those efforts. `MFMod` is the work-horse tool used by World Bank economists to produce the twice annual compendium [Macro Poverty Outlook](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/macro-poverty-outlook) which presents concise statements of the Bank's views on the major challenges, outlook, and forecasts for almost all of the developing countries in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MFmod` framework is also used to generate customized models for individual countries. Making these models available to a broader audience in an open-source form has been a major focus of the Bank's modelling team over the past several years.  This publication is the culmination of that effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "While destined for a relatively small audience of macroeconomic modellers, it is hoped that it will generate significant benefits both for the Bank, which will benefit from feedback on the models, and for clients who will have for the first time access to the Bank's models in a costless form.\n",

    "This book and the development of ModelFlow would not have been possible without the contributions of many individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Special thanks to Jens Boldt, formerly of Danmarks Nationalbank, for his participation in creating the first version of ModelFlow, which was used for the top-down stress testing of banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to extend our gratitude to the following reviewers for their invaluable contributions and insights:\n",

    "- Freya Casie\n",
    "- Unnada Chewpreecha\n",
    "\n",
    "Their expertise and feedback have significantly enhanced the quality of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models themselves reflect the inputs of many over many years, these include but are not restricted to: Thanh Bui; Benoit Campagne; Unnada Chewpreecha; Young Il Choi; Charl Jooste; Francis Dennig; Alex Haider; Monika Matyja; Chung Gu Lee; Theo Janse van Rensburg; Heather Ruberl; and David Stephan.\n",

    "This work has benefited enormously from the generous financial support of the Climate Support Facility  [https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/climate-support-facility](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/climate-support-facility), a multi-donor Trust Fund administered by the World Bank that supports developing countries achieve a green recovery from the effects of COVID-19, implement their NDCs and develop long-term climate strategies.
