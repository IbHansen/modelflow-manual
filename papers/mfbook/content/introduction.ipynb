    "# Foreword\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the decades, the World Bank has invested heavily in the tools available to its country economists to analyze forecast and monitor economic activity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `MFMod` framework, a system of 184 macro-structural models of nearly all the economies in the world, is the fruit of those efforts. The framework is at the heart of the main `MFMod` model that is the work-horse tool used by World Bank economists. The data and equations of `MFMod` are updated twide a year and used to produce the twice-annual compendium  [**Macro Poverty Outlook**](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/macro-poverty-outlook), which presents concise statements of the Bank's views on the major challenges, outlook, and forecasts for almost all of the developing countries in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MFMod` framework is also used to generate customized models for individual countries. Most recently it has been used extensively in the World Bank's [Country Climate Development Reports](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/country-climate-development-reports) to model the impact of climate change in developing economies, and is also being used to analyze long-term prospects for the Bank's forthcoming *Growth and Jobs reports*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making these models available to a broader audience in an open-source form has been a major focus of the Bank's modelling team over the past several years.  This publication is the culmination of that effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this book is destined for a relatively small audience of macroeconomic modellers, it is hoped that it will generate significant benefits both for the Bank, via feedback on the models, and for clients who will have for the first time access to the Bank's models in a costless form.\n",

    "\n",
    "This book and the development of ModelFlow would not have been possible without the contributions of many individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Special thanks to Jens Boldt, formerly of Danmarks Nationalbank, for his participation in creating the first version of ModelFlow, which was developed initially for the top-down stress testing of banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to extend our gratitude to the following reviewers for their invaluable contributions and insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Freya Casie\n",
    "- Unnada Chewpreecha\n",
    "\n",
    "Their expertise and feedback have significantly enhanced the quality of this manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MFMod framework itself reflects the inputs of many, over many years. Major contributors include but are not restricted to: Andrew Burns; Thanh Bui; Benoit Campagne; Unnada Chewpreecha; Young Il Choi; Charl Jooste; Francis Dennig; Alex Haider; Monika Matyja; Chung Gu Lee; Theo Janse van Rensburg; Heather Ruberl; David Stephan; and Baris Tercioglu.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparation of this manual and the development of the World Bank extensions to `ModelFlow` have benefited enormously from the generous financial support of the Climate Support Facility  [https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/climate-support-facility](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/climate-support-facility), a multi-donor Trust Fund administered by the World Bank that supports developing countries achieve a green recovery from the effects of COVID-19, implement their NDCs and develop long-term climate strategies.
