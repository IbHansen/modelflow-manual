    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "This Jupyter Book is work in progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This paper describes the implementation of the World Bank's MacroFiscalModel (MFMod, see {cite:t}`burns_world_2019`) using the open source solution program ModelFlow ([Hansen, 2023](https://ibhansen.github.io/doc/index)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The impetus for this paper and the work that it summarizes was to make available to a wider constituency the work that the Bank has done over the past several decades to disseminate Macro-structural models[^1] -- notably those that form part of its MFMod (MacroFiscalModel) framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The MFMod Framework at the World Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "MFMod is the World Bank's work-horse macro-structural economic modelling framework. It exists both a linked system of 184 country specific models that can be solved either independently or as a larger system (```MFMod```), and as a series of  standalone customized models, known collectively as MFMod Standalones (MFMod SAs) that have been developed from the central model to the fit the specific needs of individual countries. Both modelling systems can be solved using the EViews modelling languiage, or through the intermediation of an easy-to-use excel front end developed by the Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main ```MFMod``` global model evolved from earlier macro-structural models developed during the 2000s to strengthen the basis for the forecasts produced by the World Bank. Some examples of these models were released on the World Bank's isimulate platform early in 2010 along with several CGE models dating from this period. These earlier models were substantially extended into what has become the main MFMod (MacroFiscalModel) model during 2014. Since 2015, MFMod replaced the Bank's RMSIM-X model ({cite:p}`addison_world_1989`), as the Bank's main tool for forecasting and economic analysis, and is used for the World Bank's twice annual forecasting exercise [The Macro Poverty Outlook](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/macro-poverty-outlook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main documentation for `MFMod` are {cite:t}`burns_world_2019`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Climate aware version of MFMod\n",
    "Most recently, the Bank has extended the standard MFMod framework to incorporate the main features of climate change {cite:p}`burns_climate_2021`-- both in terms of the impact of the economy on climate (principally through green-house gas emissions, like $CO_2, N_{2}O, CH_4, ...$) and the impact of the changing climate on the economy (higher temperatures, changes in rainfall quantity and variability, increased incidence of extreme weather) and their impacts on the economy (agricultural output, labor productivity, physical damages due to extreme weather events, sea-level rises etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variants on the model initially described in  {cite:t}`burns_climate_2021`, have been developed for [xx] countries and underpin the economic analysis contained in many of the World Bank's  [Country Climate Development Reports](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/country-climate-development-reports).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Early steps to bring the MFMod system to the broader economics community\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank staff were quick to recognize that the models built for its own needs could be of use to the broader economics community. An initial project `isimulate` made several versions of this earlier model available for simulation on the [isimulate platform](https://isimulate.worldbank.org) in 2007, and these models continue to be available there.  The `isimulate` platform housed (and continues to house) public access to earlier versions of the MFMod system, and allows simulation of these and other models -- but does not give researchers access to the code or the ability to construct complex simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another effort to make models widely available a large number (more than 60 as of June 2023) customized stand-alone models (collectively known as called MFModSA - MacroFiscalModel StandAlones)  have been developed from the main model. Typically developed for a country-client (Ministry of Finance, Economy or Planning or Central Bank), these Stand Alones extend the standard model by incorporating additional details not in the standard model that are of specific import to different economies and the country-clients for whom they were built, including: a more detailed breakdown of the sectoral make up of an economy, more detailed fiscal and monetary accounts, and other economically important features of the economy that may exist only inside the aggregates of the standard model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and dissemination around these customized versions of MFMod have been ongoing since 2013. In addition to making customized models available to client governments, Bank teams have run technical assistance program designed to train government officials in the use of these models, their maintenance, modification and revision. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving the framework to an open-source footing\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in the MFMod family are normally built using the proprietary [EViews](www.eviews.com) econometric and modelling package. While offering many advantages for model development and maintenance, its cost may be a barrier to clients in developing countries.  As a result, the World Bank joined with Ib Hansen, a Danish economist formerly with the European Central Bank and the Danish Central Bank, who over the years has developed ```modelflow``` a generalized solution engine written in Python for economic models. Together with World Bank, Hansen has worked to extend ```modelflow``` so that MFMod models can be ported and run in the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper reports on the results of these efforts. In particular, it provides step by step instructions on how to install the `modelflow` framework, import a World Bank macrostructural model,  perform simulations with that model and report results using the many analytical and reporting tools that have been built into `modelflow`.  It is not a manual for `modelflow`, such a manual can be found [here](https://ibhansen.github.io/doc/index) nor is it documentation for the MFMod system, such documentation can be found here {cite:p}`burns_world_2019` and here {cite:p}`burns_macroeconomic_2021`, {cite:p}`burns_climate_2021`). Nor is it documentation for the specific models described and worked with below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Economic modelling has a long tradition at the World Bank.  The Bank has had a long-standing involvement in macroeconomic modelling, initally with linear programming polanning models {cite:p}`chenery_studies_1971`, and then CGE models {cite:p}`dervis_1986`. Indeed, the popular modelling package GAMS, which is widely used to solve CGE and Linear Programming models, [started out](https://www.gams.com/about/company/) as a project begun at the World Bank in the 1976 {cite:p}`addison_world_1989`."
