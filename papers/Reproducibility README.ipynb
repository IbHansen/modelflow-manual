       "This package includes information needed to reproduce the Charts and Tables in *The World Bank's MFMod Frameworkin Python with Modelflow*. It is comprised of the data set used in the report and from which all the tables and charts are derived, the Jupyter Notebooks that perform the simulations and generate the graphics and tables in the report as well as a python build script that runs all of the Jupyter notebooks and outputs the Charts and Tables and binds them into a PDF which is the actual book.  The Jupyter Notebooks can be run independently or in the python build program.\n",

Declaring a separate environment for `ModelFlow` will help prevent conflicts between different versions of packages from arising.\n",
